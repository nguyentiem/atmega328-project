ADEN: ADC Enable
ADSC: ADC Start Conversion
ADATE: ADC auto trigger  The trigger source is selected by setting the ADC Trigger Select bits, ADTS inADCSRB.
ADIF: ADC Interrupt Flag
ADIE: ADC Interrupt Enable
ADC Prescaler Select Bits These bits determine the division factor between the system clock frequency and the input clock to the ADC.
